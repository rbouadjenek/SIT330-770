## Textbook: Information Retrieval

[Introduction to Information Retrieval](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html)
- Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan, and Hinrich Schütze
   - Draft chapters, April 1, 2009!

This textbook teaches web-era information retrieval, including web search and the related areas of text classification and text clustering from basic concepts. Written from a computer science perspective by three leading experts in the field, it gives an up-to-date treatment of all aspects of the design and implementation of systems for gathering, indexing, and searching documents; methods for evaluating systems; and an introduction to the use of machine learning methods on text collections. All the important ideas are explained using examples and figures, making it perfect for introductory courses in information retrieval for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in computer science. Based on feedback from extensive classroom experience, the book has been carefully structured in order to make teaching more natural and effective. Although originally designed as the primary text for a graduate or advanced undergraduate course in information retrieval, the book will also create a buzz for researchers and professionals alike.

## Textbook: Natural Language Processing

[Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft) ](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)
- Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin
    - Draft chapters in progress, January 7, 2023

This book takes an empirical approach to language processing, based on applying statistical and other machine-learning algorithms to large corpora. Methodology boxes are included in each chapter. Each chapter is built around one or more worked examples to demonstrate the main idea of the chapter. Covers the fundamental algorithms of various fields, whether originally proposed for spoken or written language to demonstrate how the same algorithm can be used for speech recognition and word-sense disambiguation. Emphasis on web and other practical applications. Emphasis on scientific evaluation. Useful as a reference for professionals in any of the areas of speech and language processing.
